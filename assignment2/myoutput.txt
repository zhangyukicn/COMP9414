@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago This happens far too often
@JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal so they announced the 10 pm new time
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication 
Despite Mother Natures best efforts @SouthwestAirs goodhumored folks got us home safely in an area heavily affected by winter storms
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the dooronly to waste more fuelamplikely to be told we need more fuel#cycle
@USAirways we cant afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cant afford to go home
@SouthwestAir you call this customer service Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr lost bag and you give me a $100 voucher
@AmericanAir  cruel amp unusual to Cancelled Flight flight wo notice amp make someone stay on hold for 30min amp listen to the same ad in a loop
@AmericanAir finally at final destination but not wo extra significant travel expenses amp missed work How can you resolve this experience
@united youll be hearing from me for sure

@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living chargesI love being here for two extra days
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal   doesnt work on mobile Its a 404  
@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was no longer available just because it wouldnt accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC

@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage
@AmericanAir awesome Thx
@USAirways yes but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request  50 mins Late Flightr nothing

@united airlines On flight UA 1669 Need to make UA 3781 Can u hold the plane for us
@AmericanAir its taken care of already Ive come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls
@AmericanAir Its not about weather its logistics Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me Why not get more desk agents
@united why would they make me share a room
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weatherâœˆï
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken
@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying think about your next flight #customer #outrage  
@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem but wait for luggage for 4 hours IT MUST BE DELIVERED
@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145
@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile The link auto changes on mobile Desktop works fine
